A Simon Game with HTML, CSS and JavaScript
Thanks to Beau Carnes of FreeCodeCamp for the tutorial for the JavaScript. I made modifications to the HTML and CSS and recorded and used my own sounds. 
I also recorded a custom "error" sound for when you click the wrong color and added that to the JavaScript -- other than that, the JavaScript is mostly as shown in the tutorial.
